## Achievements

### 2020 Drove significant monthly recurring revenue with strategic IBM Public CLoud client

Led a Global Cloud Acceleration Team (GCAT) engagement with an Irish-based client to grow their monthly recurring revenue by over 400%. Worked directly with the client's senior technical staff at to design and deliver a public isolated cloud platform that met their large data processing needs. Engaged with C-Suite execuites at the client to demonstrate the business value, scalability, security & robustness of the agreed architecture.

### 2017 Productionization of reasearch asset to drive user efficiency

Led a combined team of IBM researchers, engineers and UX to develop a natural language text summarization component for SaaS-based Care Management solution. The component used a combination of 3rd party and custom annotators to identify domain entities from unstructured text. It also used a novel ranking algorithm with learning loop to generate user-based, role-based and time-based summaries of unstructured text (case notes). The component saved Care Managers preparation time in advance of calls with vulnerable clients by making summarized case notes available to them.

### 2016 Presented at Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Conference

Delivered poster presentation at 2016 conference. The paper presented was based on M.Sc. practicum submission. Practicum demonstrated a novel technique to measure the similarity between social media personalities (a.k.a. influencers), their followers and businesses. The technique was based on the classification of text-based social media output using the _Alchemy_ taxonomy. The algorithm provided a way for business to measure how good of a fit an influencer or a sample of their follorwers was for their business.
