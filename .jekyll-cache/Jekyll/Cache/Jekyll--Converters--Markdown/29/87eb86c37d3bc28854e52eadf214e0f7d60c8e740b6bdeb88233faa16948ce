<p>Led a combined team of IBM researchers, engineers and UX to develop a natural language text summarization component for SaaS-based Care Management solution. The component used a combination of 3rd party and custom annotators to identify domain entities from unstructured text. It also used a novel ranking algorithm with learning loop to generate user-based, role-based and time-based summaries of unstructured text (case notes). The component saved Care Managers preparation time in advance of calls with vulnerable clients by making summarized case notes available to them.</p>

<h3 id="2016-presented-at-irish-conference-on-artificial-intelligence-and-cognitive-science-conference">2016 Presented at Irish Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Conference</h3>

<p>Delivered poster presentation at 2016 conference. The paper presented was based on M.Sc. practicum submission. Practicum demonstrated a novel technique to measure the similarity between social media personalities (a.k.a. influencers), their followers and businesses. The technique was based on the classification of text-based social media output using the <em>Alchemy</em> taxonomy. The algorithm provided a way for business to measure how good of a fit an influencer or a sample of their follorwers was for their business.</p>
